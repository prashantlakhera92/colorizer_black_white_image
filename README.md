Project Title: AI-Based Black & White Image Colorizer

Project Summary:
This project focuses on developing an AI system capable of transforming black-and-white (grayscale) images into realistic color images. The core idea is to leverage deep learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), to predict the plausible colors for objects, backgrounds, and textures in grayscale photos.

The system is trained on large datasets of color images, learning patterns between grayscale intensities and their corresponding color values. Once trained, the model can automatically colorize historical photos, old family pictures, or any grayscale image, restoring them with visually appealing and contextually accurate colors.

Key Features:

Automatic colorization without manual input

Realistic and context-aware color prediction

Support for a wide variety of images, including portraits, landscapes, and urban scenes

Technologies Used:

Python, TensorFlow / PyTorch

CNNs for feature extraction

GANs for realistic color generation

OpenCV / PIL for image processing

Applications:

Restoring historical photographs

Enhancing black-and-white media for modern audiences

Creative tools for artists and designers

Future Enhancements:

User-guided colorization (allowing manual hints for specific colors)

Video colorization using temporal consistency

Deployment as a web or mobile application
