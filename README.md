# colorizer_black_white_image
This project converts color images into black-and-white (grayscale) format by preserving only pixel intensity values. Grayscale images emphasize contrast, edges, and structure while reducing complexity and processing cost, making them ideal for computer vision, preprocessing, OCR, and image analysis tasks in lightweight or real-time applications.
